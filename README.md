# Kedge

Tired of writing tests cases? Want to add contracts to your crate? Or, even more
crazy, _synthesize_ your crate? Kedge offers it all. Choose your level of
automation best suited for your project.

## Quick Start

Everything is centralized into `kedge-cli`. Choose whichever features you need
for your project.

| Goal                                | Feature     |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Want to automatically create tests? | `test`      |
| Want to use formal tools on your    | `harness`   |
| functions _without_ changing them?  |             |
| Want to add contracts?              | `contracts` |
| Want to synthesize code             | `synth`     |
| Want to synthesize specifications?  | `spec`      |
